# JavaFX-Count-the-Fruits-Game

This javaFX application is created to teach primary school children counting, colours and fruits.
Factory design pattern is used.

GameFactory class is used to create the objects of the suitable classes.
GameApp contains the main methods and the structure of the game.
Superclasses are BearSet, AppleSet, BerrySet and PearSet are also subclasses of Game Object.
Subclasses such as blueberry, redapple where I set the image of the fruit and update the start method to make them move.
